# 🎧 VoxFlow AI

VoxFlow AI is a desktop application designed to streamline the creation of audiobooks and audio content. Built with modern web and Rust technologies, it allows you to visually script, synthesize natural-sounding speech using Alibaba Cloud Bailian, and manage your audio projects with ease.

> **Note:** This application uses the **Alibaba Cloud Bailian (DashScope)** platform for its Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. You will need a valid API Key from the platform to use the synthesis features.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ **Alibaba Cloud Bailian Integration** — High-quality TTS synthesis powered by models like Qwen3 TTS Flash.
- ⚙️ **User-Configurable Settings** — Easily input your API Key, select models, and adjust default voice settings (speed, pitch, voice) directly from the application UI.
- ⏱️ **Adjustable Intervals** — Fine-tune the silence between script lines to ensure natural pacing.
- 💾 **Robust Data Management** — Built-in SQLite database ensures data integrity and prevents conflicts during manual script creation.
- 🖥️ **Modern Desktop Experience** — Powered by Tauri 2.0 for a lightweight, secure, and native feel.
